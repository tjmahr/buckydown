# buckydown

Custom pdf bookdown format

## Installation

You can install buckydown from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:


```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tjmahr/buckydown")
```

## Sources

This package borrows the package infrastructure of huskydown for making a
dissertation pdf in with bookdown but uses a LaTeX template I found online. All
the demo text and documentation wrongly talks about the University of Washington
and huskydown, so bear with me.

## Testing from within this package

To test the PDF template stored in `inst/` assuming we are at top level. Rebuild
the package. Then:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
buckydown::test_thesis_pdf()
```
